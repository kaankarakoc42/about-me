# Who am I
hello guys first of all l will introduce myself. who is mevlüt kaan? l was born in Konya at 17 nov. 2004 and l was grew up in Seydişehir (this is my home town) and l turned 16 in the past weeks. Now l am studying at Karatay Science Highschool. I am interseted in computer engineering for 3 years. l started to computer science with arduino (it is a card which there is a microprocecor(atmega) on it that you controlle it via programming )
and c++ (Arduino.h library) but then I lost interest in mechatronics. So l wanted the learn a high level language like python. I improved myself at  python for 2 years l learned to use a lot of frameworks and libraries like flask(website backend developing framework ),opencv(for image processing), Selenyum(for web bots). But after writing a few websites l decided the python is not my language beacuse l want to programming mobile apps and that was not possible with python so l switch my language to javascript and l am trying to develop mobile apps with react-native framework (it is a framework that provides you to make cross-platform(android,ios) mobile apps) .l hope that l will be a good engineer in the future.
